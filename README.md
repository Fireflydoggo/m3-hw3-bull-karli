Troubleshooting Factors:

1. The Dine-In and World's Best Burger section would not separate, until I placed the inline-flex in the variables.less file not the main.less file.
2. The Logo and Order Now button got linked to the opacity overlay on the background, once I was able to isolate it, I could not get all three images to overlap one another until I took out the flex positioning and replaced it with absolute and relative placements.
